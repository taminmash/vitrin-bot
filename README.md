# Vitrin Spain Bot

Railway MVP Telegram bot for Vitrin Spain.

## Active Architecture

- Entrypoint: `bot.py`
- Runtime config: `config_v2.py`
- Database layer: `database/db.py`
- Handlers: `handlers/`
- Railway process: `worker: python bot.py`

## Environment Variables

Set these in Railway:

- `BOT_TOKEN`
- `DATABASE_URL`

## Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bot.py
```

## Deployment

The app uses long polling. Railway only needs the worker process from `Procfile`.
Database tables and additive columns are created on startup by `init_db()`.
